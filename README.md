An automobile company wants to launch new car in the market.

The company wants to know:

• Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car

• How well those variables describe the price of a car

This system is to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
